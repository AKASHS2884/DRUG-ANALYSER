# DRUG-ANALYSER
PROBLEM STATEMENT: TO REDUCE TIME CONSUMPTION IN MEDICINE(drug) INNOVATION INDUSTRY AND TO CREATE PERSONALISED DRUG DESIGNS FOR INDIVIDUALS INTEGRATE QUANTUM & AI 
SOLUTION: An AI BASED APPLICATION/SOFTWARE THAT INTEGRATES QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHICH FINDS DRUG MATCHINGS AND PERSONAL DESIGNING OF DRUGS FOR SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS AT A VERY FAST RATE WITH HIGH EFFICIENCY

!!!!!REQUEST: AS THIS PROJECT IS ON THE DEPTH OF  RESEARCHIVE SIDE I KINDLY REQUEST THE EVALUATORS TO GOTHROUGH THE "SCALEUP DOCUMENTATION" FOLDER ON THIS REPO FOR GETTING CLEAR VIEW OF THE PROJECT!!!!!!!

LANGUAGES USED: FLUTTER-DART,JAVASCRIPT,KOTLIN AND PYTHON FOR ALGORITHM DESIGN  
MODEL PROTOTYPE: https://previewer.adalo.com/7ab65fa8-ff4c-40d4-998e-5e006b10b55e

TECH STACK USED:-

1.QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY- DATA RETRIVEMENT AND PARTICLE STUDY
DFT TECHNIQUE- IMAGE IN JPEG FORMATS USING TUNNEL SCANNING

2.ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE- NEURAL REGRESSION CT-700 - PREDICTION MODEL 
                           BINARY REGRESSION MODEL  - ANALYSIS MODEL

BENEFITS/PROS:-
Reduces time consumption in drug innovation.
Saves millions of lives from pandemic and clinical trials.
Drugs and data for various diseases can be found easily.
Unique medicinal drugs for specific individuals can be designed.
By reducing the research cost and time involvement we can made medicines affordable to all class of people.


SDG-BENEFITS:-
A quantum drug analysis system significantly contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by ensuring the efficacy and safety of medications, leading to improved health outcomes. It also supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by fostering advancements in pharmaceutical research and development. Additionally, by optimizing drug use and reducing adverse effects, it aids in achieving SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), promoting sustainable healthcare practices.
